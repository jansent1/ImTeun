        <h3>Design and Development</h3>
        <p>Ever since I was a little boy I used to design and develop by trial and error. Many times braking down the family computer.
          But eventually I came to a point that I could start improving the system we used. By the time I was 12, Youtube came along. This opened up a whole new world for me.
          Now I could actually see other programmers at work and learn from them! Another ten years later and my hobby turned into two functional
          development companies.</p>

        <h3>What else...?</h3>
        <p>Besides programming languages, I'm pretty good at regular languages. I've had English, German, Dutch, French, Russian and Chinese courses and clients over the past 15 years.
          Being able to communicate with co-workers in their own language is nothing more than polite. Bookkeeping, sales and marketing became part of my job along the way.</p>
